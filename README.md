## Hey, I'm Nikhil ðŸ‘‹

I'm a (mostly back-end) software developer. I currently work at [Monolith](http://monolith.xyz/). I've previously worked at [comparethemarket](https://github.com/ComparetheMarket) and [Jigsaw XYZ](https://github.com/jigsawxyz).

My experience mostly is in creating, maintaining, testing and working on REST or gRPC microservices in node (written in JavaScript & TypeScript) and related libraries. I have some experience with Docker & Kubernetes.
