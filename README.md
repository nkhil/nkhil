## Hey, I'm Nikhil ðŸ‘‹

I'm a (mostly back-end) software developer. I currently work at [Monolith](http://monolith.xyz/).

Some tech I've used: 

- Typescript / Node
- Docker / Docker Compose
- gRPC
- Express with openAPI / Swagger
- Kubernetes (limited experience)

I've also worked with a fair few test frameworks including Chai, Mocha, Jest & Ava, Cucumber & Gherkin.
